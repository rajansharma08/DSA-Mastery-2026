## 3. Repository Structure üìÇ

Every problem I solve is organized to showcase not just the solution, but the thinking behind it. Each problem has its own dedicated folder, which contains:

- **`ProblemName.java`**: A clean, efficient, and well-commented Java solution.
- **`README.md`**: A detailed document outlining:
  - The problem statement.
  - My **intuition** and the process of moving from a brute-force to an optimal solution.
  - A step-by-step breakdown of the final **algorithm**.
  - A thorough **complexity analysis** (Time & Space).

## 4. Tech Stack üíª

- **Primary Language:** `Java`
